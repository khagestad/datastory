          <p> The Data Collection was the first project we worked on this semester. It involved deciding what kind of data I wanted to collect, what I needed to include,
          and how I wanted to set up my collection log, along with the actual collection of the data. I decided to collect data about how I use my phone. I collected information on what type of apps I use, the duration I use them for, and the time of day they're being used. I also decided
          to track whether or not I got a notification with each instance of use, and whether or not I was procrastinatiing. What came of it is several days filled with data about the ways I used my phone. I was surprised to see how my phone use changed throughout a week, and how I use my phone the majority of the time. Look at all that data!
